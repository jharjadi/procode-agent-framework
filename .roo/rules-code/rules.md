IMPORTANT WORKFLOW RULES:
1. If a DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md file exists in the project root, read it FIRST before starting any task
2. NEVER commit code before testing it thoroughly
3. ALWAYS use project-specific scripts (like ./push-to-dockerhub.sh) instead of direct commands
4. Follow the workflow: Test → Verify → Commit → Build → Deploy
5. When making changes, always test locally or in Docker before committing

Check for DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md, README.md, or CONTRIBUTING.md at the start of each task for project-specific rules.
